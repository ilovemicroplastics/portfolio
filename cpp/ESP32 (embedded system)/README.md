# ESP32 Code
This is a lose collection of C++ code for the ESP32.
I wrote them to learn how to use an ESP32 (to then apply that knowledge to this [project](https://github.com/ilovemicroplastics/OpenScoutV1-1)), most of them are simple but openscout_control is complex. A select few are from a tutorial, but I'm keeping them here to reference.

It was an interesting challenge.
