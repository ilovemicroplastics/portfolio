# Parallel programming coursework
This is a graphics processing program I wrote in Apr 2024.
It isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's worthy of mentioning as parallel programming might as well be an esotric language with how people don't really learn it (as far as I know).

It was written as part of coursework, and there is an associated [document](<Parallel Programming.pdf>) which analyses how efficient the program is.
