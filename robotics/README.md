# ROS2
[OpenScout Controller (physical).](https://github.com/ilovemicroplastics/OpenScoutV1-1/tree/main/Software/Controller)
This controls a robot called the OpenScout, although admittedly I would consider this controller a beta-test. 

[OpenScout Gazebo Simulation.](https://github.com/ilovemicroplastics/OpenScoutV1-1/tree/main/Software/simulation/openscout_ws)
It was created jointly with a colleague from university. Ahmad prepared the CAD model, whilst I (Bartosz) did the programming.
The simulation looks very clean but isn't accurate to real physics owing to the fact that it uses skid steering, which is hard to implement in a simulation.
I have a lot to say about this, but to make a long story short: this wasn't an easy project and I'm happy with the result.

# Physical Robotics
[OpenScout](https://github.com/ilovemicroplastics/OpenScoutV1-1)
The repo explains what it is, but here I can provide some background information.
This started as coursework (to modernise an old OSH design), but then as a group we decide to continue working on it to publish the work to a conference.
We did not get accepted, but we made good progress on the project.
Something that I'd like to highlight is the fact that most of the commits were made by me.
That is because others were focused on finishing assignments (we did it in the middle of a MSc course).
While I don't blame them for being busy, the fact of the matter is that I put a lot of effort into every segment of this project.
This gave me practical experience with electronics, micro-controller programming, practical workshop skills, robot simulations, procuring parts, and paper writing.
